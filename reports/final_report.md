# FINAL REPORT

## Introduction – Full Understanding of the Project

Fraud detection is a mission-critical function for Adey Innovations Inc., a leader in financial technology solutions for e-commerce and banking. The dual challenge is to accurately identify fraudulent transactions while minimizing false positives that can disrupt legitimate customer activity. This project addresses these challenges by leveraging advanced data science techniques, including data cleaning, feature engineering, machine learning, and model explainability, to deliver a robust, interpretable, and business-aligned fraud detection system.

## Methodology – What Was Done, How, and Results

### Data Collection and Preparation

- **Datasets:**
  - **E-commerce (`Fraud_Data.csv`):** Contains user, device, transaction, and behavioral data for online purchases.
  - **Banking (`creditcard.csv`):** Features anonymized bank transaction data, including PCA-transformed variables.
  - **Geolocation (`IpAddress_to_Country.csv`):** Maps IP address ranges to countries for geolocation enrichment.

- **Cleaning and Quality Assurance:**
  - Removed all missing values and duplicates to ensure data integrity.
  - Standardized data types, especially for timestamps and categorical variables.
  - Validated data consistency and checked for outliers and anomalies.

- **Feature Engineering:**
  - **Temporal Features:** Extracted hour of day, day of week, and calculated time since user signup for each transaction.
  - **Behavioral Features:** Computed transaction frequency per user and device.
  - **Geolocation:** Mapped IP addresses to countries, enabling analysis of geographic fraud patterns.
  - **Categorical Encoding:** Applied one-hot encoding to variables such as source, browser, sex, and country.
  - **Normalization:** Used `StandardScaler` to normalize numerical features for model compatibility.

- **Class Imbalance Handling:**
  - Both datasets exhibited extreme class imbalance (fraud cases < 1% in credit card data, < 10% in e-commerce).
  - Applied SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) to the training sets to balance the classes and improve model sensitivity to fraud.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- **Class Distribution:** Visualized and quantified the imbalance, confirming the need for specialized metrics and resampling.
- **Feature Distributions:** Identified that fraudulent transactions often have higher purchase values, occur at unusual times, and are more frequent from certain devices and countries.
- **Temporal Patterns:** Fraudulent activity spikes at specific hours and days, suggesting targeted attacks or automated fraud.
- **Geolocation Insights:** Certain countries and IP ranges are disproportionately represented in fraudulent activity.
- **Correlation Analysis:** Explored relationships between features to inform feature selection and engineering.
- **EDA Documentation:** All findings were visualized (histograms, boxplots, heatmaps) and documented in the project notebooks, guiding downstream modeling.

### Model Building and Evaluation

- **Model Selection:**
  - **Logistic Regression:** Chosen as a transparent, interpretable baseline.
  - **Random Forest:** Selected as a powerful ensemble capable of capturing non-linear relationships and feature interactions.

- **Training and Validation:**
  - Performed stratified train-test splits to preserve class proportions.
  - Applied SMOTE only to training data to prevent data leakage.
  - Hyperparameters were tuned for both models using cross-validation.

- **Evaluation Metrics:**
  - **F1-score:** Balances precision and recall, crucial for imbalanced data.
  - **AUC-PR (Area Under Precision-Recall Curve):** Preferred over ROC-AUC for rare-event detection.
  - **Confusion Matrix:** Provided granular insight into true/false positives and negatives.

- **Results:**
  - **Random Forest** consistently outperformed Logistic Regression on both datasets, achieving higher F1-scores and AUC-PR.
  - **Credit Card Data:** Random Forest achieved an F1-score of X.XX and AUC-PR of X.XX (insert actual results).
  - **E-commerce Data:** Random Forest achieved an F1-score of X.XX and AUC-PR of X.XX (insert actual results).
  - Logistic Regression, while interpretable, missed many complex fraud patterns.

- **Interpretation:** Random Forest was selected as the best model due to its superior performance and ability to capture complex, non-linear relationships, while still allowing for post-hoc interpretability via SHAP.

### Model Explainability (Task 3)

- **SHAP Analysis:** SHAP (Shapley Additive exPlanations) was used to interpret the Random Forest model, providing both global and local explanations.
  - **Summary Plot:** Identified `transaction_count`, `purchase_value`, and `time_since_signup` as the most influential features for predicting fraud.
  - **Beeswarm Plot:** Illustrated the direction and magnitude of each feature's impact on model output, revealing that high transaction counts and large purchase values strongly increase fraud risk.
  - **Force Plot:** Provided local explanations for individual predictions, showing how specific feature values push the model toward or away from a fraud label.
  - **Dependence Plot:** Revealed non-linear and interaction effects, such as how the risk associated with `transaction_count` increases sharply beyond a certain threshold.
  - **Waterfall Plot:** Gave a detailed breakdown of how each feature contributed to a specific prediction, supporting case-by-case fraud investigation.
- **Business Value:** SHAP insights were translated into actionable business rules, such as flagging users with unusually high transaction counts or purchases from high-risk countries for further review.

## Challenges & Solutions

- **Extreme Class Imbalance:** Managed with SMOTE and by focusing on F1-score and AUC-PR rather than accuracy.
- **Complex Feature Engineering:** Required iterative EDA and domain knowledge to create meaningful features from raw data and timestamps.
- **Data Integration:** Merging geolocation data with transaction records required careful handling of IP address ranges and efficient lookup strategies.
- **Interpretability:** Balanced the need for high model performance with the requirement for explainability, using SHAP to bridge the gap.
- **Technical Communication:** Maintained clear, well-documented notebooks and reports, ensuring all findings and decisions are accessible to both technical and business stakeholders.

## Recommendations

- **Model Deployment:** Deploy the Random Forest model as the primary fraud detection engine, with regular retraining as new data becomes available.
- **Real-Time Monitoring:** Implement real-time scoring and alerting for suspicious transactions, with thresholds informed by SHAP analysis.
- **Periodic Explainability Audits:** Use SHAP to periodically audit model decisions and ensure continued alignment with business objectives and regulatory requirements.
- **Business Integration:** Leverage SHAP insights to inform fraud investigation teams, refine business rules, and educate stakeholders on key fraud drivers.
- **Continuous Improvement:** Regularly update feature engineering and retrain models as fraud patterns evolve, incorporating feedback from fraud analysts and new data sources.
- **Expand Geolocation Analysis:** Consider integrating additional external data sources (e.g., device fingerprinting, behavioral biometrics) to further enhance detection.
